# Crate
## Project Summary
This project picks up an open source brownfield codebase project for subscription clothing orders. The user can create an account, sign in and subscribe and unsubscribe to and from "Crates". The objective of this project was to add new features to the user profile. The user should be able to customize their profile in a form with an image, name, email, bio, and shipping address info. The user should be able to adjust delivery dates on their subscriptions. Lastly, the user should be able to see past orders and see which products within those order they kept. We weren't able to complete this application because of numerous blockers in our process, including a new language/framework for the backend team, and working in a large and messy codebase with unusual patterns to follow. We were able to allow the user to edit their profile, but that frontend experience does not properly hit the intended endpoint setup on the backend.
